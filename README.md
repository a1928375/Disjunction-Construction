# Regular Expressions

(1) Disjunction Construction:  Assign to the variable regexp a regular expression that matches either the exact string ab or one or more digits.

(2) Hyphenation:  Assign to the variable regexp a Python regular expression that matches lowercase words (a-z) or singly-hyphenated lowercase words.  Hint: It may not be possible to get correctly - do your best!

(3) Re Challenges:  Assign to the variable regexp a Python regular expression that matches single-argument mathematical functions. The function name is a lowercase word (a-z), the function argument must be a number (0-9), and there may optionally be spaces before and/or after the argument.  Hint: You may need to escape the ( and ).
