# Regular Expressions

(1) Disjunction Construction:  Assign to the variable regexp a regular expression that matches either the exact string ab or one or more digits.

(2) Hyphenation:  Assign to the variable regexp a Python regular expression that matches lowercase words (a-z) or singly-hyphenated lowercase words.  Hint: It may not be possible to get correctly - do your best!
